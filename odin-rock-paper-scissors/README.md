This project is about making a rock, paper, scissors game in JavaScript.

I firstly created a simple script to play the game and show results in the console.
After this first approach, I added the graphic interface by using HTML and CSS

Finslly, I thought it would be a good idea to add something else to the challenge so I made the rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock from the Big Bang Theory.
