#The Odin's Landing Page Project

This is the second project from the Odin curriculum. In this challenge, the objective is to practice more HTML and CSS by making a landing page similar to an asset that they give.

## My project: Drawin'Works
By taking the structure they give in the assignhment, I made a simple design of a landing page of stationary products, named Dreamin'Works.
I focused on the use of flexbox containers and items and I also changed the content for responsiveness.

These are some highlights of this project:
    - Use of semantic HTML
    - Good structure for HTML
    - Apply flexbox to each section
    - Use shadows for some boxes
    - Make it responsive

This is the final result:
