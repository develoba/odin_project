# The Odin's Recipes Project
This is the first project from The Odin curriculum. The objective is to practice HTML, CSS and the use of Git and Github.

It is a simple project in which the web page should contain some recipes pages and a home page. Also, all pages should contain some heading, unordered lists and ordered lists.

# My Project: Rolls Joy
Taking these assignments, I started making some designs. Since I already have some basic CSS knowledge, I wanted to practice also those skills and recreating some animation styles since I didn't know how to do them.

I first thought about this web idea of Rolls, like Cinnamon Rolls, New York Rolls (very famous here in Spain) and some other recipes; all of them should be roll desserts. 

Some highlits of my projects are:
- Use as most as HTML semantic tags as possible (header, main, nav, section)
- Use a good HTML structure
- Apply grid and flexbox to containers
- Make an infinite rotation animation
- Make an infinite horizontal scroll of images and recipe titles (marquee animation)
- Make it responsive

This is one of my first "big" projects, using only HTML and CSS. You can check the live site here: https://astonishing-torrone-1b7beb.netlify.app/
